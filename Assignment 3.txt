Assignment 3: Tic-Tac-Toe

I started out the assignment by drawing out the boards on paper and labeling
the end points of each of the line segments.  I figured getting everything
to look right would be the hardest part.  The bigest problem I encountered
was creating the overload for the angles.  It took me a while to see
that the endpoints had to be calculated by angle and radius from the center
rather than the top left like the rest of the boards.  I also learned
about the double data type and how to convert data types.  Next time I might 
try writing comments as I go rather than doing them all at the end.

Fields vs. Local Variables

The NsccWindow reference needs to be a field, because it is needs to be accesable
by everything else.  This is where the boards are being drawn.  The NsccLine references
need to be local to the draw function, because you are creating new lines everytime the
function is callled.  If the line references were a field, you would just be changing them
everytime the function was called.  Also, the reason the NsccWindow is private is because
it is not meant to be messed with by outside sources.  It is created specifically for the
use of the Tic-Tac-Toe class.
