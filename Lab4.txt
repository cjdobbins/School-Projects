Lab 4: Vertical Alignment

1. 6

2. Method 1 and 2 both function the same, but Method 2 is harder to 
follow because it has no indentation.

3. Method 3 is a little harder to read than Method 2, because the "}"
are at the end of the line instead of on the next line.

4. When the TAB key was pressed, everything was automatically indented,
and Method 2 now looks identical to Method 1.

5.  In Method 5 everything gets aligned with the open paranthesis "("
on the previous line.

6.  It's hard to tell what line 56 is "trying" to align with.  The
previous line contains the end of a println statement, the end of the
if statement, the whole i ++ statement, and the beginning of a new
statement.  At best it seems to be lining up with the close
parenthesis ")" on the line above.
