Assignment 2:  Flags

	I started out this assignment with the "This looks easy... I can do this approach."
I started learning programming last year with a Java based language called Processing
which is designed for making graphics and works fairly similar to NsccWindow.  So, 
I didn't plan anything out and I just started writing code.  I ended up having to completely
start over on the flag of Sweden, because I thought it would be easier just to calculate
the yellow cross instead of making four rectangles.  It would have worked out, but you
have to get rid of the black outline.  So, when I switched over to the four rectangle 
approach I did something wrong with the calculations, and ended up with a plain yellow
flag.  I finally got it working, but it would be beneficial to take some time 
to plan before running head first into a brick wall.
