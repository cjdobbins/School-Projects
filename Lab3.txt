Lab 3: Constructors

1.  The declaration and instantiation need to come first in order
to create a new instance of the snowman that we will be dealing with.
If the declaration and instantiation did not come first we would be trying
to build, color, and add a face to an object that did not exist yet.

2.  The buildSnowman method must be called first. 

3. The order of the other method calls does not matter.  Once the window 
with an empty snowman is created we can add features in any order.

4.  The buildSnowman method must be called first, because it creates the window
and the empty snowman shape.

5.  When the SnowmanII object is instantiated, the buildSnowman method is automatically
called, and a new window with the empty snowman is created.

6.  This version behaves the exactly the same.  Instead of having a constructor the calls
the buildSnowman method, the buildSnowman method has become the constructor.  Same effect
and less code.

7.  This version will not compile, because the constructor name must be the same as the
class name.  The compiler thinks you are trying to create a method, but it is missing the
return type.

8.  This version will also not compile, because it appears that you are trying to declare
a method, but the name SnowmanII can only be used as a constructor.
