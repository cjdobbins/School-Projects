Assignment 4: Scene Creation

I started out this assignment by drawing out the scene.
I mapped out the critical points for the objects location
and size, and I started programming.  Everything went pretty smooth
although I was pretty busy this week, so I didn't get to do the challenge
part.  I also thought it would be cool to link the objects size to it's
y-axis location, so that the closer the object is placed to the horizon,
the smaller it would become.  That way you would have some sense of 
perspective rather than just rubber stamping houses and trees all over
the place.  Next time I will try to start earlier, so I can accomplish
the more challenging parts.

Answers to questions:

1.  setLocation works for MyHouse and MyTree, because it is inherited
from the NsccComponent class.  Since both MyHouse and MyTree are 
NsccComponents, they can be relocated just as easy as a NsccRectangle
or NsccEllipse.

2.  setSize does not work as well for MyHouse and MyTree.  Although
it is inherited from NsccComponent, it only changes the component size.
Therefore when you set the size to something smaller than your house or
tree then you just end up chopping off whatever lies outside the bounds
of the component.

3.  In order to get setSize to work for MyHouse and MyTree, a new
setSize function would have to be created for each.  The size of
each piece would have to be set relative to the bounds of the 
component size.  For example the width of the roof would be equal
to the width of the component, and the height of the roof would be
perhaps 1/2 the height of the component, rather than having a hard 
coded width and height.  We had to do these calculations to make sure
that the original house and tree would fit inside their respective 
components anyway, so it probably would be pretty easy to just code
the sizes of the shapes as a ratio to the size of the component that
contains them.
