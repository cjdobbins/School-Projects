Quiz 5: Rounding

1. 3.0000001E10

2. On the 10th run of the loop the error becomes noticeable.

3. The f designates the number as a float.  

4. Without the f it is assumed that 3.0 is a double and you
 will get a type mismatch error.

5. 2.9999999999999997E28

6. On the 27th run of the loop the error becomes noticeable.

7. Removing the f does not change anything.

8. Changing 3.0 to 3 does not change anything either.

9. Since n is declared as a double & is repeatedly multiplied by 10.0, also
a double, the calculations are the same.

10. The error seems to go away.  Further down the line the error fluctuates,
going up and down by a small amount.  This may be why the error looks like it
disapears after the first time it shows up.
