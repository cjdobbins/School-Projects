Assignment 5: Shape Hierarchy

I started out this assignment by mapping out which shapes 
would inheret the properties of the other shapes.  The square
is a rectangle so it only needs to change its name.  Everything else
can be used from the rectangle class.  The same goes for the 
relationship between the circle and ellipse class.  The biggest problem
I had was with the triangle.  When I ran TestShapes and entered 3 by 5 for
the dimensions of the triangle, it would return an area of 7.0 instead
of 7.5.  It took me a while to realize it was because I was multiplying
and dividing integers, which returns another integer.  Changing 
width * height/2 to width * height * .5 solved the problem.  In
the future I could probably solve problems like this more quickly
by using the interactions pane instead of running the program.
