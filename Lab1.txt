Lab 1: Programming Background

1. Keyword - A word recongized by a programming language that performs a certain process.  
		A keyword can't be used as a function or variable name.

2. Local Variable - A local variable is local to a particular function.  If a local variable is used outside
		the function that defines it then it will not be recongized.

3. while statement - The while statement runs as a loop while a certain condition is met.  
		Once the condition is no longer met then the loop ends.

4. Calling a function means that the program is being told to jump to a function that has been defined.  
		Variables can be passed to a function and the function can return a result.

5. An assignment statement assigns a name and a value for a variable - x = 20

6. Data types - String, int, float, boolean, list

7. The pseudo code finds the absolute value of x

8. x = 2

9. f(f(x)) = 14

10. Using python

for i in range(1, 11):
   print(i)

or

x = 0
while x < 10:
   x += 1
   print(x)

or

x = []
for i in range(1, 11):
   x.append(i)
print(x)
