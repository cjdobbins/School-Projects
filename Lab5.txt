Lab 5: Snowman's Hat

1.  The class won't compile with the constructors given.  The two constructors are calling each other.

2.  The hat goes away.  The reference to the hat is declared null and the window is repainted.

3.  You get a null pointer exception error. There is no hat for the move hat function to manipulate.

4.  You can only move the newest hat.  When a new hat is added, the reference "theHat" points to
the new hat, and there is no longer any reference to the old hat.  The old hat is basically locked in
at this point.

5.  SnowmanIII is designed to "wear" an NsccComponent as a hat.  If the new hat class is not a subclass
of NsccComponent, then it won't inherit all the goodies of NsccComponent, and the SnowmanIII class won't
be able to use it.

6.  As long as the component size is set large enough to include all the pieces that you want to
display then you're good to go.  I purposely made the component size too small to cut off the bottom 
half of the ellipse in my hat class.
