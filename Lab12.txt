Lab 12: Collections

1.   private java.util.ArrayList<String> reindeer;

2.     reindeer = new java.util.ArrayList<String>();

3.     deer.reindeer = new java.util.LinkedList<String>();

4. They give the same output.

5. The array list is printed first.  Then the linked list with the same
names is printed.  Then the names are added to the linked list again, and
the list is printed with all of the names occuring twice.

6.     deer.reindeer = new java.util.HashSet<String>();

7. When the HashSet is printed the names come out in a different order.

8. Duplicates are thrown out.  After the names are added to the HashSet
a second time the names still only show up once.
